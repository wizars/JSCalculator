Calculator with simple Java Script, HTML and CSS



I created this calculator in Java Script as part of the [Odin Project course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator)

It's all simple JS, CSS and HTML. You can click the buttons or you can use the keyboard
